### QA Engineer Assessment - React Todo App

Welcome to the Gesture Tech QA Engineer take-home challenge!

In this repository, you will find the code for the **React Todo App**. Your task is to create comprehensive automated tests based on the specified requirements to ensure the application's functionality and reliability.

## 📋 Task Requirements

- **Toggle Checked State**: Clicking on a todo item should toggle the “checked” state.
- **Persist State**: The todo list state should be saved to and loaded from local storage.
- **Auto-Sink Checked Items**: Checked items should sink to the bottom of the list automatically.

## 🎯 Your Mission

As a QA Engineer, your mission is to create automated tests in `App.test.tsx` that validate the application's functionality based on the requirements listed above. Develop test cases that cover:

### 1. Toggling Todo Items
- **Verify** that clicking a todo item changes its checked state.

### 2. State Persistence
- **Ensure** that the todo list is correctly saved to local storage.
- **Confirm** that the todo list is accurately loaded from local storage upon application start.

### 3. Auto-Sinking Checked Items
- **Test** that checked items automatically move to the bottom of the list.

*Feel free to consider edge cases and additional scenarios that may affect these functionalities.*
