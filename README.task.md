# Automated Testing for React Todo App

This document provides guidelines for writing test cases for the React Todo App based on the requirements specified in the primary README file. The objective is to ensure that the application's functionalities are correctly implemented and reliable.

## Task Overview

The primary task is to create comprehensive automated tests that cover the following functionalities:

1. **Toggle Checked State**: Ensure that clicking on a todo item toggles its "checked" state.
2. **Persist State**: Verify that the todo list state is saved to local storage and correctly loaded upon application start.
3. **Auto-Sink Checked Items**: Confirm that checked items automatically move to the bottom of the list.

## Test Implementation

All test cases are to be implemented in the `App.test.tsx` file. The following sections describe the expected behavior and provide hints for implementing the test cases.

### 1. Toggling Todo Items

- **Objective**: Validate that clicking a todo item changes its checked state.
- **Implementation Hints**:
  - Render the `TodoItem` component.
  - Simulate a click event on a todo item.
  - Assert that the checked state of the item changes accordingly.

### 2. State Persistence

- **Objective**: Ensure that the todo list state persists through local storage.
- **Implementation Hints**:
  - Render the `App` component.
  - Simulate adding a new todo item.
  - Verify that the item is saved in local storage.
  - Refresh the component and confirm that the saved state is loaded from local storage.

### 3. Auto-Sinking Checked Items

- **Objective**: Test that checked items automatically move to the bottom of the list.
- **Implementation Hints**:
  - Render the `App` component.
  - Simulate checking a todo item.
  - Assert that the checked item appears at the bottom of the todo list.

## Code Changes Made for Testing

The following code changes were made to facilitate testing:

* Added an `index` property to the `TodoItem` component to create a unique `id` for each todo item.
* Modified the `TodoList` component to use the `index` property to create a unique `key` for each todo item when rendering the list.

## Known Issues
Please note that currently all the test cases are failing due to not having the code for storing and retrieving the todo list from local storage. This is intentional as the task is to implement the required code for the test cases to pass.

## Running Tests

To execute the test suite, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will run all tests in watch mode, providing quick feedback on test results.

## Conclusion

Developing thorough test cases based on the outlined requirements will help ensure the React Todo App functions as expected. Always consider edge cases and additional scenarios that may affect these functionalities. Use clear and descriptive test case names to improve readability and maintainability.
